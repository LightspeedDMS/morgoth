// Test: Focus switching between panes
// Spec: MORGOTH-SPEC.md § Phase 1.2 - Focus Management
// Priority: P1
//
// Purpose:
// Validates that focus can be moved between panes using an index. Tests
// the focus state variable, next/previous cycling, and bounds wrapping.
//
// Expected behavior:
// - Initial focus is pane 0
// - Switching to pane 1 updates focus index
// - Next/previous cycling wraps around
